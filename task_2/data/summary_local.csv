Gambar1.jpg,"This image depicts a dimly lit street scene at night, likely after rain, as the ground appears wet and reflective.

In the foreground and extending into the mid-ground, a dark asphalt road with a faint white dividing line runs from the bottom center into the distance. The road surface is visibly wet, reflecting the light sources present. To the left of the road, a blue fence or barrier runs parallel to the street, behind which is dense, dark foliage from trees.

On the right side of the image, there are several brightly lit structures, possibly small shops or food stalls. These structures have a visible corrugated metal roof, and strong artificial lights emanate from them, creating a significant glare and illuminating the immediate area. Several motorcycles are parked on the right side of the road and sidewalk, with one parked prominently in the mid-ground on the right. A light-colored block or small barrier is also visible on the sidewalk. Further to the right, a reddish-brown wall or gate is partially visible.

In the background, more bright lights create a hazy glow, suggesting further activity or establishments down the street. The sky above is dark and partially obscured by the canopy of trees, which line both sides of the street but are most prominent on the left. The overall impression is an active, yet somewhat damp and quiet, urban or semi-urban street at night."
Gambar10.jpg,"The image captures a nighttime scene on a street, likely in a town or city, characterized by a dominant, bright streetlight that casts a strong, almost hazy glow. The perspective is from ground level, looking down the length of the street.

In the foreground, the ground on the immediate left is dark, unpaved earth with some sparse green growth and scattered debris. To the right, the paved road appears wet and highly reflective, suggesting recent rain or damp conditions.

The road stretches into the distance, gently curving to the right. Its wet surface reflects the light, creating a mottled pattern of bright and dark areas. Numerous trees with dense foliage line both sides of the street, their leaves partially illuminated by the artificial light, while their trunks remain largely in shadow.

A very bright, almost blinding streetlight is positioned prominently in the upper center of the frame, emitting a strong, yellowish-white light that diffuses and creates a noticeable haze around it. This light is the primary source of illumination for the scene. Other, dimmer streetlights or building lights are visible further down the road, contributing to the overall illumination.

On the left side of the street, behind the unpaved ground, there are simple structures, possibly made of corrugated metal or wood, partially obscured by trees. Several vehicles are parked on this side; one motorbike or scooter has a brightly lit headlight, and another classic-style scooter (resembling a Vespa) is also visible.

The right side of the street features various low-rise buildings, some with visible signs and colorful facades (such as yellow and red), suggesting small shops or residences. Several indistinct figures can be seen near these buildings, indicating some activity. More motorbikes are parked along this side, and a red bicycle is visible on the far right.

The sky is dark and mostly obscured by the tree canopy and the glow from the streetlights. The overall atmosphere is that of a quiet but lived-in urban corridor at night, with the wet surfaces and strong artificial lighting creating a distinct visual mood."
Gambar11.jpg,"This image captures a vibrant night scene along a street, illuminated by artificial lights against a dark sky.

In the mid-ground on the left, a prominent, brightly lit turquoise rectangular sign with white text and a circular emblem is visible. The text appears to read ""KLINIK KATU BAR"" or similar. Below the sign, a street food stall or market operates under a light-colored tent canopy. Several people are gathered around the stall, some seated on stools at tables, suggesting customers enjoying food or drinks. A light blue scooter is parked nearby, and another person is seated on a low stool further to the left.

To the right, a paved road stretches into the distance. A tall street lamp pole stands on the side of the road, with its bright light source glowing intensely in the upper right quadrant of the image, casting a significant glow on the scene. On the road, a white SUV is visible, heading away from the viewer, with a light-colored box truck closely behind it, also moving in the same direction. Faint red lights in the far distance suggest more traffic or distant establishments.

The foreground consists of unpaved ground, a mix of dark earth and patches of light green grass, which appears somewhat uneven. Tree branches with dark foliage are visible against the night sky in the upper left and central portions of the image. The overall atmosphere is lively and active, characteristic of an urban or semi-urban area at night."
Gambar2.jpg,"The image depicts a narrow, paved residential street or alleyway under a uniformly overcast, light gray sky. The dark gray asphalt road extends from the foreground into the distance, appearing to narrow slightly as it recedes. Green grass and weeds grow along both edges of the road, particularly visible on the left side.

On the left side of the street, closer to the foreground, there are concrete steps and an elevated platform leading up to a house, only partially visible. A red scooter is parked near this area. Further down on the left, a house with a distinctive light blue facade and an orange-framed doorway is visible. Beyond it, a tall, gray utility pole stands prominently, adorned with a white oval-shaped street lamp extending to the left and numerous black electrical wires strung across the street. Lush green foliage, including large-leafed plants resembling banana trees, fills the spaces between and behind the houses on this side.

On the right side of the street, in the foreground, there are concrete blocks and what appears to be a small drainage channel. Further down, a white metal gate with a decorative 'X' or diamond pattern is slightly ajar, revealing a glimpse of a house behind it. Adjacent to this, there is a smaller, standalone house with a dark, steeply pitched roof and light-colored walls. Clothes are seen hanging on a line or rack outside this house, and various objects are scattered around its entrance. More houses and trees are visible further down the right side of the street, with another street lamp in the distance.

The overall scene suggests a quiet, modest residential area, possibly in a village or a less developed urban neighborhood."
Gambar3.jpg,"The image captures a view down a quiet, seemingly residential street on an overcast day.

The sky, filling the top third of the frame, is heavily laden with dense, light grey and white clouds, suggesting a cloudy or potentially rainy day with diffused light. Numerous thin utility wires crisscross the sky, extending from poles down the street.

On the immediate left, a dark-colored, multi-story building dominates the foreground. A prominent, bright blue cylindrical water tank is situated on its roof. A gnarled, bare tree trunk stands in front of this building, its branches reaching upwards and rightwards, partially obscuring the structure and overhead wires. Below the blue tank, a white vertical pipe runs down the side of the building. A balcony with a black railing is visible, and below it, an orange-red vine or climbing plant spills over a low black fence that runs parallel to the street. Further down the left side, more buildings recede into the distance.

The street itself is a dark grey asphalt road, stretching straight into the background and appearing to narrow with perspective. On the left side of the road, near the foreground, there's a patch of dark, uneven ground with sparse green grass/weeds and a visible puddle of murky water. A large, grey, irregularly shaped object, possibly covered by a tarp, rests on the far left.

Parked on the left side of the road, facing away from the viewer, is a dark-colored scooter or motorcycle, mostly covered by a light-colored sheet or cloth.

On the right side of the street, a row of single-story buildings, likely homes or small shops, stretches into the distance. One building further down has a visible green sign with text, part of which reads ""SABHANA JAYA."" Utility poles with transformers are scattered along the right side, supporting the network of overhead lines that traverse the entire scene.

In the far distance, the road appears to continue towards a cluster of trees and less distinct structures, blending into the cloudy horizon. The overall lighting is flat, resulting in a muted color palette dominated by greys, dark blues, and earthy tones, giving the scene a calm, somewhat subdued atmosphere."

Gambar7.jpg,"This image captures a nighttime view of a narrow, residential street or alleyway, illuminated by artificial lights.

On the left side of the street, a dense, lush hedge with vibrant clusters of orange-red and some pink flowers (resembling bougainvillea) cascades over a fence. Below the hedge, a narrow concrete sidewalk is lined with numerous potted plants in various containers, some appearing rustic or worn. Streetlights overhead cast a greenish glow on this verdant foliage.

The street itself is paved with dark asphalt. In the mid-ground, a black cat stands prominently in the center of the road, facing left with its tail slightly raised. Further back and to the left, near the curb, a lighter-colored, possibly tabby, cat is also visible, looking in the same direction.

On the right side of the street, a dark-colored scooter or moped is parked on a textured, lighter-colored sidewalk (resembling cobblestones or gravel). The scooter has a white covering draped over its seat or handlebars. Standing behind the scooter, near a building entrance, is a person (appearing to be a young adult) wearing a light-colored jacket and dark pants. They are looking down the street towards the left. A bright, blue-white light source is prominent on this side, illuminating the area around the person and building.

The street recedes into the background, where more residential buildings are visible, partially obscured by trees and the darkness. Glowing streetlights create a sense of depth, with a warm, orange-yellow light visible at the far end of the lane. The overall scene suggests a quiet, peaceful evening in a densely vegetated urban or suburban setting."
Gambar8.jpg,"The image captures an outdoor scene of a residential street or alleyway under an overcast or hazy sky.

In the foreground, on the left side, a reddish-brown, small utility or cargo vehicle (possibly a three-wheeler or a small truck) is parked. The word ""KINCA"" is visible on its back. Next to and in front of the vehicle, there's a pile of refuse, including cardboard boxes, plastic bags, and other debris, lying on a dirt patch beside the paved road. Shadows are cast on the ground from the left, extending towards the right.

The paved road occupies the central and lower-middle portion of the image, stretching into the distance. A person wearing a light blue shirt and a helmet is riding a dark-colored scooter or moped away from the viewer, on the right side of the road. Further down the street, a dark sedan is also visible, either parked or slowly moving.

On the right side of the road, a light-colored, multi-story building (at least two stories, possibly three) with balconies and dark metal railings is prominent. An air conditioning unit is attached to the upper floor. A dark metal fence runs along the front of this building's ground level. Behind it, a smaller, single-story light green building can be seen.

On the left side of the road, opposite the larger building, there are simpler, perhaps shacks or basic structures, partially obscured by dense green foliage. A street light attached to a pole is visible here. Numerous black power lines crisscross the sky, connecting to utility poles on both sides of the street.

The sky is a uniform light grey, indicating an overcast day. The overall impression is that of an active residential area, possibly in an urban or semi-urban setting, with a mix of newer and older structures, and overhead infrastructure."
